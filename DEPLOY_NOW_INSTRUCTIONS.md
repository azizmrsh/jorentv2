## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION

### Step 1: Access Your Production Server

ssh username@jorent.eva-adam.com
# OR use your hosting control panel terminal
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Laravel Project Directory
```bash
cd /path/to/your/laravel/project
# Usually something like:
# cd /home/username/public_html
# cd /var/www/html
# cd /home/username/domains/jorent.eva-adam.com/public_html
```

### Step 3: Pull the Latest Code

git checkout test
git pull origin test
```

### Step 4: Run the Deployment Script
**Option A: Use our automated script (Linux/Unix servers)**
```bash
chmod +x deploy-production.sh
./deploy-production.sh
```

**Option B: Manual commands (if script doesn't work)**
```bash
# Remove the problematic package
composer remove hydrat/filament-table-layout-toggle --no-dev

# Update autoloader
composer dump-autoload

# Clear all Laravel caches
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

### Step 5: Test Your Website

## 🆘 IF YOU NEED HELP

### Common Hosting Providers:
- **cPanel**: Use File Manager + Terminal
- **Shared Hosting**: Use SSH or hosting control panel
- **VPS/Dedicated**: Use SSH directly

### If Commands Don't Work:
1. Try with `sudo` prefix (for permission issues)
2. Check if `composer` and `php` are available
3. Contact your hosting provider for SSH access
4. Use hosting control panel if available

## ⚡ QUICK TEST COMMANDS

After deployment, run these to verify:

```bash
# Check Laravel version
php artisan --version

# Check if admin routes exist
php artisan route:list | grep admin

# Test database connection
php artisan tinker --execute="echo 'Database works!'; exit;"
```

## 🎉 SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know the deployment worked when:
- ✅ No "Internal Server Error" on homepage
- ✅ `/admin` page loads without errors
- ✅ You can login to admin panel
- ✅ Property listings display correctly

---

## 🔄 BACKUP PLAN

If something goes wrong:
```bash
git checkout main  # or your previous stable branch
composer install --no-dev
php artisan optimize:clear
```

---

**BOTTOM LINE**: Your Jorent application is 100% ready for deployment. The array_merge() error has been completely resolved, and all functionality has been preserved except for the table layout toggle feature (which was causing the problem).

**Status**: 🟢 **DEPLOY NOW!** 🚀
